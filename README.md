# hello-world
The Hello World project is a time-honored tradition in computer programming. It is a simple exercise that gets you started when learning something new.

So, I feel way to old to start a new thing like programming and source control with GitHub.
But I figure people reinvent themselves all the time, so ... I'm Steve Lundberg, version 2... or SteveLver2 for you.
